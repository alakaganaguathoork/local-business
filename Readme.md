# Description
This project is a Local Business Open API that provides information about local businesses using data from RapidAPI. It allows users to search for businesses based on various criteria such as location, category, and ratings.

I want to describe my project in Readme.md file in git repo, so I could share it as a pet-project on interviews. in short: a small Python app (Flask) which triggers one endpoint with /test, /health and /metrics additional debug endpoints > Dockerfile for image building with a pipeline (Azure DevOps pipelines) for building and pushing to Docker Hub > docker-compose.yml to run the app with additional services (the app, a sample db, and monitoring stack) > terraform code to provision infrastructure in Azure and AWS (the main project is `aws/projects/eks-automode` which provisions EKS with networking, security groups, RBAC, helm release of ArgoCD with custom values) with custom modules and terraform cloud > monitoring stack custom configs for Prometheus rules, targets and alerts, Graphana custom dashboard (Loki and Alloy would be added shortly) > Helm chart for this app > Azure DevOps pipelines for app deployment configured to be ran on a self-hosted agent which is running locally on my host machine in docker (with a trigger on a webhook from Terraform Cloud when infrastructure was applied successfully) using Bash@ tasks in general with custom pipeline templates for each stage (like, connect to cluster, setup env which install tools like aws-cli, kubectl and helm, install ArgoCD Application from helm chart in a running cluster, and monitoring stack)
